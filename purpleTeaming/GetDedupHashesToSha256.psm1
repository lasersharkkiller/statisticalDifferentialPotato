function Get-DedupHashesToSha256{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Intelligently de-duplicates an IOC CSV by first normalizing all file
    hashes (MD5, SHA1) to their SHA256 equivalent using the VirusTotal API.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script reads a CSV with an "IOC" column.
    1.  If an IOC is an MD5 or SHA1, it queries the VT API to find its
        corresponding SHA256. It then *replaces* the IOC value with the SHA256
        and uses this SHA256 as its "master ID".
    2.  If an IOC is a SHA256, it's used directly as the "master ID".
    3.  If an IOC is a domain or IP, it's also used directly as its "master ID".
    The script then de-duplicates the entire list based on this "master ID".
    The final output is a new CSV file containing only the *unique* rows,
    with all hash IOCs converted to SHA256.
